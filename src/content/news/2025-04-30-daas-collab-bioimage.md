The NFDI4BIOIMAGE and DataPLANT consortia have joined forces to develop a flexible Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) and Desktop-as-a-Service (DaaS) solution 
designed to support the evolving needs of researchers in data-intensive scientific environments. This collaborative service offers researchers remote access to 
fully featured desktop environments—mirroring their typical lab or facility workstations. These desktops are optimized for interactive data analysis, graphical 
image processing, and remote training scenarios, all from any location with internet access offering moderate bandwidth.

The Freiburg-based DaaS platform brings the full software-hardware stack of imaging facility workstations into the cloud. Users can run standard viewing, image 
manipulation, and analysis tools directly next to the data source—eliminating the need to transfer large datasets to personal machines just to inspect or analyze 
them. By enabling analysis near the data, the system reduces unnecessary data duplication and movement, saving time and storage while streamlining research workflows.
Users access an identical environment to their local imaging desktops, including support for very high-resolution displays (given sufficient bandwidth). Typical 
usage only requires 10 Mbit/s for full-HD and under 100 Mbit/s for high-resolution, dynamic workflows—far less than what would be needed to transfer full datasets.

In the future typical cloud resources (like from de.NB) can be repurposed for non-interactive jobs during off-hours, and researchers no longer need to physically 
visit facilities to use specialized equipment. This increases flexibility and makes scheduling more efficient. The platform ensures that data remains within defined 
secure environments, supporting use cases involving sensitive or protected datasets. This could be of interest to further consortia in the NFDI. An online demo is 
already available, and access can be granted upon request. The service is also planned to integrate with broader research infrastructure initiatives such as Life 
AAI used e.g. in DataPLANT and IAM4NFDI (providng access to all NFDI members), ensuring seamless authentication and identity management across the NFDI landscape.
