The consortium [GreenRobust](https://greenrobust.de) got selected as cluster of excellence. The partners from the University of Tübingen, University of Heidelberg, the University of Hohenheim and the MPI for Biology Tübingen will investigate robustness of plants along three interconnected research areas. These are responses to climatic and biotic perturbations, covering molecular, cellular, organismal, and population levels, as well as different key plant families (Brassicaceae, Solanaceae, Poaceae) of ecological and agricultural relevance.
We congratulate and look forward on a hopefully fruitful collaboration.
