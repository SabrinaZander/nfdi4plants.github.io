The University of Freiburg hosted a well attended Cross-NFDI Meeting, bringing together representatives from various 
National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI) consortia. The event, organized by the university’s Central Data Facility 
(CDF), highlighted the university’s commitment to advancing FAIR research data management and fostering interdisciplinary 
collaboration.

The Central Data Facility (CDF), which coordinates RDM efforts across the university, opened the meeting with an overview 
of its mission to consolidate and streamline data initiatives on campus. Consortia from the NFDI community, including 
DataPLANT, shared insights into their services, resources, and contributions to the broader scientific landscape. DataPLANT 
presented key components of its services, such as: The DataHUB platform for data storage and sharing, tools for metadata 
annotation, consulting services like DataPLAN and data publication services (ARChive) as well as workflow integration with 
the Galaxy platform.

While these services already benefit a wide range of disciplines, participants emphasized the importance of expanding 
support to research communities that currently lack strong local NFDI connections. A short discussion round focused on 
questions central to building stronger institutional ties, including: "What can NFDI consortia offer to other researchers 
at the University of Freiburg?", "What support do NFDI projects require from the university?" or "How can researchers 
include NFDI expertise in their grant proposals?" The meeting also spotlighted existing collaborations, such as the 
cross-consortia use of the Galaxy workflow system, and explored opportunities to deepen cooperation. The event concluded 
with a strategic conversation on how the University of Freiburg can enhance its engagement with the NFDI beyond formal 
affiliations—positioning itself as a hub for data-driven research.
