On th 16th May DataPLANT presented at Erlangen-Nürnberg university research data management colloquium. 
A core objective of the DataPLANT consortium is to foster FAIR data management, collaboration, and data 
publication to drive the cultural change toward Open Science. To achieve this, the consortium is 
developing a science gateway and tools and services to assist with daily routines. They serve as a 
technical foundation that applies software engineering-inspired approaches to handling both data and 
computational workflows, making them broadly accessible to plant researchers.

Conceptionally, DataPLANT promotes the [Annotated Research Context (ARC)](https://arc-rdm.org/) - a 
framework designed for organizing and documenting research data and metadata annotation while acting 
as a container that continuously facilitates collaboration, data exchange, and adherence to FAIR 
principles across various researchers and the complete data life cycle. Further, the consortium puts 
a strong focus on offering personnel assistance in the form of data stewards to advice researchers 
as well as labs on data management best practices in the plant sciences.

DataPLANT got positive feedback on offering low barrier services in the form of the 
[DataHUB](https://git.nfdi4plants.org/explore) which do not require local resources to start in to 
ARC handling, workflow execution and data publication. The [knowledge base](https://nfdi4plants.github.io/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/) 
as well as the regular online meetings of the data steward cicle offer good [
starting points](https://nfdi4plants.github.io/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/start-here/).
