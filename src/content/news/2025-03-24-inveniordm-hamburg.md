From March 24 to 28, DataPLANT and the University of Freiburg's computing center were represented at the 
InvenioRDM community meeting in Hamburg. InvenioRDM is the open source software that runs the 
[ARChive](https://ARChive.nfdi4plants.org) for publishing ARCs. The datasets can be permanently 
referenced by DOIs. The software emerged from a project at CERN. It is the basis of the well-known 
and widely used Zenodo. Many science-led organizations now also rely on it. InvenioRDM could 
potentially also become an jointservice for the NFDI. The developer community is broad and very 
active.

The meeting at the University of Hamburg was organized according to the Open Space technology. New 
features and expectations of the community were discussed in workshops. The connection with other 
systems and the sustainability of data were a particular focus. A continuous flow of data and 
its publication is a core of Open Science. This is implemented in DataPLANT through the ARC 
publication workflow, which is currently being updated.
