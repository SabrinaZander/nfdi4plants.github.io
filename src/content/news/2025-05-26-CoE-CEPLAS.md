Our friends and colleagues from the Cluster of Excellence [CEPLAS](https://www.ceplas.eu) could secure the funding for a third phase. The Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research (IPK) in Gatersleben have joined the consortium. Under the title “SMART Plants in Dynamic Environments” research on phenotyping platforms, crop genetics and genomics will continue.
We congratulate and look forward to continue our fruitful collaboration.
