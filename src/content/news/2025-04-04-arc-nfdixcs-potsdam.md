DataPLANT recently took part in the 2nd NFDIxCS Symposium, held in Potsdam. This event brought together 
experts from Computer Science and related disciplines to exchange ideas, foster interdisciplinary 
collaboration, and drive forward the goals of the National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI).

The symposium featured a rich program focused on improving Research Data Management (RDM), with 
discussions around emerging tools like the RDMC and approaches to achieving FAIR data publications
a core objective of our consortium.

DataPLANT was actively involved throughout the event. We contributed with a talk highlighting our 
work on ARC (Annotated Research Contexts) and especially on ARC RO-Crates, and the DataHUB — key 
components of our ecosystem supporting structured, reusable research data. Our presentation focused 
on how these elements facilitate better organization, sharing, and reuse of scientific outputs.

In addition, we participated in a panel discussion on FAIR RDM, where we explored both the 
opportunities and the challenges of implementing FAIR principles in real-world research settings.

Another focus of our contributions was the Galaxy platform, directly accessible from the DataHUB, 
which we showcased as a powerful tool for working with structured data containers like ARC RO-Crates.
We demonstrated how Galaxy can be integrated into RDM workflows to enhance reproducibility, 
transparency, and automation.

Reproducibility remains a central challenge in data-driven science. In our discussions, we 
emphasized how concepts like ARC RO-Crate and frameworks like Galaxy help address these 
challenges—by supporting workflow reuse, tracking provenance, and ensuring that data and 
etadata remain tightly linked throughout the research process. Overall, the symposium provided a 
valuable space for dialogue and collaboration.
