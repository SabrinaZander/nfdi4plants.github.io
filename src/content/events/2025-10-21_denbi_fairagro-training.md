Have you ever wondered what research data management is all about? Why is it so important? What is special about managing data from agrosystem research? Then de.NBI & ELIXIR-DE, FAIRagro and DataPLANT have created the perfect interactive training for you - a mix of presentations and interactive, hands-on exercises!

More and more funders require research data to be published, archived, and accompanied by Data Management Plans (DMPs) to distribute their grants. We will show you how Annotate Research Contexts (ARCs) and DMP-Tools can facilitate this, in addition to boosting the efficiency of your day-to-day work during the research project.

In just a few hours, you will first learn the basic principles of Research Data Management (RDM, October 21st), afterwards you will have the opportunity to learn how to translate research project proposals into appropriate DMPs (October 22nd) - what does a DMP contain? Why is a DMP useful for you and your project - beyond fulfilling the funders requirements? How can you create a DMP and what Tools can help? Last but not least you will learn the fundamentals of ARCs (October 23rd), how these structured data containers can help you organize your research data in a standardized way and how to design an ARC for your specific research needs. 

Data management experts will guide you through the basics of RDM, the do's and don'ts, and how to improve the management of data produced in agrosystem research projects. Following a brief introduction to the research data lifecycle and the FAIR data principles, we will:

- explore the concept of a DMP and ARCs through interactive hands-on sessions.
- focus on agricultural data, such as soil data, geospatial data, genetic data, phenotypic data, sensor data and general field data. 
- examine components, language, software and examples of DMPs. 
- assess potential problems and solutions and self-evaluate a draft DMP for our own projects in alignment with the FAIR principles.

This workshop is for anyone working with agrosystem science data, interested in active learning, and gaining skills in both research data management and writing DMPs.

## Learning goals

- Know the research data life cycle.
- Know the FAIR principles and understand their importance.
- Know the expectations for a DMP.
- Be able to sketch a DMP.
- Know the concept of the Annotated Research Context (ARC) – DataPLANT’s implementation of a Fair Digital Object (FDO).
- Know how to use the tool ARCitect to create [ARCs](https://arc-rdm.org) for your datasets, annotate them with metadata and share them via the [DataHUB](https://git.nfdi4plants.org).

## Prerequisites

- A computer with internet connection, a webcam, a microphone and a browser.
- Before the workshop, users are kindly asked to:

  1. Sign up for a DataPLANT account: https://register.nfdi4plants.org/
  2. Install ARCitect https://nfdi4plants.org/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/arcitect/

We also offer an optional tech-check on one of the preceding days, if needed.

## Tools

RDMkit, DSW, RDMO, ARCs
