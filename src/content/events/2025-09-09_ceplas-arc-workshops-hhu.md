## Goals

- First steps into the ARC ecosystem
- Move existing datasets into <a href="https://arc-rdm.org/" target="_blank">ARCs</a>
- Annotate them with structured metadata
- Share them via the <a href="https://git.nfdi4plants.org" target="_blank">DataHUB</a>

## Modalities

Workshop seats are "first-come-first-serve" with min. 5 and max. 15 participants and priority for CEPLAS members.
To arrange an exclusive training for your lab, please ask your lab members to sign up for the same "Hands-on" session, add the group name, provide a contact person and reserve a suitable seminar room or select the "Flexible ‚Äì Lab Onboarding" and we'll arrange a larger onboarding. 

- Workshops can be arranged in person (recommended) or online; preferably not hybrid
- "Flexible ‚Äì Demo" could be arranged as part of a regular lab seminar
- "Hands-on" if done in-person, requires laptops for all participants
- Based on previous feedback, in-person hands-on sessions are recommended

### Checklist for participants

Please prepare the following **before** a "Hands-on" workshop.

- Sign up for a [DataHUB user account](https://register.nfdi4plants.org/)
- Install [ARCitect](https://nfdi4plants.github.io/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/arcitect/)
- Bring a laptop with internet access in the workshop location and ARCitect installed

### Tech-check

Not all installations are perfectly straight-forward. We will be available half an hour before the workshop starts to help you get up and running.

## Workshop options

### Hands-on ‚Äì Basics

- ‚è±Ô∏è **Duration: ca. 3 hrs**
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Content**: Based on a demo dataset, participants learn how to use the tool ARCitect to create ARCs (https://arc-rdm.org), annotate them with metadata and share them via the DataHUB (https://git.nfdi4plants.org)

### Hands-on ‚Äì Basics + Advanced

- ‚è±Ô∏è **Duration: ca. 6 hrs + breaks**
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Content**: Basics + Explore advanced ARC features for metadata annotation of data analysis and processed datasets, metadata validation and data publication

### Flexible ‚Äì Lab Onboarding

- ‚è±Ô∏è **Duration: 2 - 3 days**, depending on the group's size, complexity of data and other requirements
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Content**: Identify how and where data is produced, stored, shared, analyzed. Apply the ARC and DataHUB concepts to your group
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note**: This workshop requires more preparation and interaction with the group. Please indicate a contact person or get in touch directly. 

### Flexible ‚Äì Demo

- ‚è±Ô∏è **Duration: ca. 1 hr**
- üßë‚Äçüè´ **Content**: Non-interactive live demo to introduce the main concepts and features of ARCs, ARC tools and services (no laptops required)
- üóíÔ∏è Afterwards participants can flexibly explore the self-guided tutorials in the knowledge base
