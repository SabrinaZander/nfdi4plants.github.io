abstract = {The technological advancements in bio-science research are resulting in the generation of vast amounts of complex and heterogeneous data sets from individual studies. Efficient Research Data Management solutions based on FAIR principles can guide the research groups toward standardizing and packaging the study-specific research results into uniquely identifiable digital objects that are easily traceable and identifiable, leading to knowledge discovery, collaboration, and innovation. However, to explore the inter-dependencies among data sets originating from different study disciplines, it is crucial to deploy a generic data-centric RDM solution that overcomes inherent challenges and helps manage complex data sets. This solution should respect participating groups’ data and security policies while providing an integrated data view. In this paper, we introduce ARC Registry, a cloud-native search \& exploration application that integrates experimental metadata from individual research groups that have deployed PLANTdataHUB (FAIR-RDM) solution. The focus is on the parts of PLANTdataHUB and ARC Registry that facilitate near-real-time integration of experimental metadata from standardized digital objects (Annotated Research Contexts) across participating research groups.},
